Just some personal solutions to the exercises in the book [Software Design for
Flexibility](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/software-design-flexibility).

## Why Julia?

Good question. Back to five years ago, I might have written it in Clojure. But
now I've forgetten most of it and do not have any plan to pick it up in the
next long period of time.

To be honest, Julia is not a good fit to solve those exercises especially if you
are a beginner. I just take it as a challenge to test my mastery of Julia,
hoping to improve my software design skills in the meanwhile.
